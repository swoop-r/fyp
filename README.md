This repository contains a customizable For You Page "FYP" template, designed for personal use or graduation portfolio websites. The template includes basic layout structures, styling, and simple interactivity.

## Features

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fyp.git
    cd fyp
    ```

2. **Edit the template**: Open `index.html` to update your content and style data.
NOTE: All style data is stored within the .html file. If needed, HTML and CSS can be split, modified, and added to the `style.css` for css styling.
   
3. **Preview the page**: Open `index.html` in your browser to see the page in action.

## Customization

- Change the color scheme by editing the `--primary-color` in `index.html`.
- Replace images and text in the HTML to personalize the page for your use.
- CSS was avoided for the sake of simplicity. Style can be broken off into independent .css if needed.
